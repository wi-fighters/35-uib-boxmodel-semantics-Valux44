          <p>
            PlayStation and Xbox may get the most attention, but many hardcore
            gamers say PCs are still the best option. They've got some good
            reasons for saying so, including having more control over hardware,
            better graphics, and better prices.<br>
            <p>PC gamers can upgrade the components inside their computers whenever they want because each component is easily
            removable, which allows them to stay on the bleeding edge of video games.
            
            Console gamers, on the other hand, are largely stuck with the components their consoles were released with. They can't
            exchange components with new ones to make games look better, or take advantage of new developments in video game
            graphics.The fact that consoles aren't upgradeable makes them theoretically obsolete the moment they're released. It also means
            that PC gaming is always ahead of console gaming in terms of graphics, as processing power is always increasing while
            consoles remain static.</p><br>
            <p>Video games on the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 look very good — certainly much better than their predecessors, the Xbox
            360 and PlayStation 3. It's because Microsoft and Sony are using much newer, more powerful components for their new
            consoles.
            
            But the components can only be so good, otherwise the console becomes prohibitively expensive for the average person.
            When Sony announced the $500 price of the PlayStation 3, people in the audience gasped. So, there's a limit to even a
            next-gen console's graphical capabilities, even though game developers can design games that far exceed those
            capabilities.Of course, it depends on how powerful your PC is, but you don't need a top-of-the line $3,000 gaming rig to run games at
            higher graphics than consoles can handle. A $400 computer can easily equal or outperform even the Xbox One or PS4.</p>
            <p>And that's not even getting into the other ways you get a better value with PC.
            
            While console platforms are catching up, PC gaming platforms like Steam and Origin are much quicker to offer sales and
            discounts than their console counterparts. I can buy "Tomb Raider" on Steam for $19.99, while the Xbox Live store only
            offers the "Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition" for $29.99.The ability to run a full desktop operating system also makes PCs more versatile than a console. For example, you can do
            some work using Microsoft Office on a PC, and you can run other software that's simply not available on consoles. So,
            PCs do offer more value than consoles in that respect.</p>
            <p>PC gamers also prefer PCs over consoles because their friends are also using PCs, which lets them play online
            multiplayer games together. There are relatively few cross-platform multiplayer games where PC and console gamers can
            play together.
            
            Others like the "mods" they can easily add to their PC games — player-created derivations of the base game — whereas
            console versions of games rarely get mod support. There's also a vast library of games that aren't available on
            consoles, like the hugely popular "League of Legends."Multiple control options is big to some PC gamers, as not everyone likes to use controllers for certain games. Some
            prefer to play first-person-shooters like "Call of Duty" with a keyboard and mouse over a controller, for example.</p>

            <h3 class="heading">Console Gaming</h3>
            <p>The console vs. PC gaming debate is a perennial battle we don’t expect to end anytime soon. But if you’re just starting
            out or looking to switch your gaming rig, a console might be the way to go. Here are seven reasons why console gaming is
            better than PC gaming.</p>
            <p>With console gaming, there’s essentially no installation process. You simply insert the disc or download the game and in
            a couple of minutes, you’re all set. There are no pesky drivers to worry about, nor you will have to download a
            separate, proprietary installation tool for a particular game.
            
            Sure, you may have to download updates if there are any, but this is a simple process. In addition, on a PC, you might
            also have to make a few adjustments specific to your machine’s specifications, like the games graphics settings in order
            to avoid framerate drops.
            
            The bottom line is that on a console, you won’t have to face the majority of the common nuances of configuring a new
            game on a PC. It just works.</p>
            <p>Another burden you can avoid by opting for a console is hardware specifications. There are thousands of options you will
            have to go through to find the right PC to suits your needs. You have to ensure the mouse is comfortable and the
            graphics card can handle the games you want to play, and check how high is the display refresh rate, and more besides.
            And you don’t have to worry about tips and tweaks to optimize your PC for gaming.With consoles, you only have to worry about your budget and desire to play 4K games. In addition, unlike PCs, consoles
            continue to perform smoothly and run the latest games even after a couple of years of use. PC rigs generally wear out
            quicker and you will be forced to upgrade two or three years down the line (especially if you want to try out the most
            recent games).</p>
            <p>With studios such as Sony and Microsoft backing them, consoles have benefited from a wide collection of AAA games. Just
            look at the best PS4 exclusives for proof.For instance, some of the most highly rated titles, such as The Last of Us, the Uncharted series, God of War (2018), and
            Red Dead Redemption 2 are not even available on PC. On the contrary, most popular PC games will be ported to consoles.</p>
            <p>Console gaming is more affordable than PC gaming. You can buy one for as little as $250 and still play each and every
            available game at 1080p. That package will even include the controller, one or two games, and possibly more. New gaming
            PCs, however, start at about $700 and that will only enable you to play the mid-tier games.Plus, you will be spending hundreds of dollars extra for other accessories, like the keyboard and mouse. In addition, on
            consoles, you can share game discs with your friends and split the cost. On PCs, licenses are locked to a specific
            account and are non-transferrable.</p>
            <p>Since consoles are compatible with televisions, you can operate and play games on them from the comfort of your sofa.
            Their controllers are also designed in a way that you won’t have to fiddle around to find the right spot.
            
            PCs, in addition to being incompatible with television displays, are not suited for non-desk setups and you will end up
            spending most of your time trying to make it work somehow. Make the sensible choice and play a console from the comfort
            of your sofa.
            
            One option you might look into is the SNES Classic Mini because you can play PS1, N64, and similar games on it.</p>
            <p>PCs also fall short in scenarios like parties or when your friends come over to hang out. Your desk probably doesn’t
            have the space for more than one keyboard and mouse, your laptop might not have enough ports, and more issues plague a
            PC’s ability to handle local multiplayer.
            
            On a console, you can simply plug more consoles in to play with your friends. In addition, consoles have slots for USBs
            too, so if you have a keyboard lying around, you can plug that in as well.What’s more, the aforementioned fifth argument supplements this advantage even further. If your monitor is a little
            small or there’s not room for more than two or three people in your study, you can quickly move to the living room where
            there is a larger television and more seating available.</p>
            <p>Controller preferences are certainly a subjective topic, and some gamers swear by arcade sticks. But if you’re new and
            still exploring video games, the controller is the way to go. It’s built with a design that more naturally sits in your
            hands, unlike the keyboard and mouse combo which has a steeper learning curve.
            
            With a controller, the fingers you’re not using can easily rest on the rear triggers and can come into play as soon as
            you want them.
            
            In addition, apart from FPS (first-person shooters) and RTS (real-time strategy) games, the joysticks are a more
            ergonomic fit for most titles. PlayStation 4’s controller also has a touchpad so that you can navigate around the
            interface easily.</p>
            <p>While PC gaming certainly has its advantages, consoles are definitely superior. As outlined in this article, they offer
            a hassle-free experience, a cheaper point of entry, and a wider selection of games.
